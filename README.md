What it does
This is a basic slot machine simulator where you:

Start with $200
Place bets on each spin
Win money when all symbols in a row match
Keep playing until you run out of money or quit

The game has 4 symbols (A, B, C, D) with different rarities and payout multipliers. Each spin shows a 3x3 grid, and you win on any row where all three symbols match.
